# A timer for toastmasters clubs

This is a timer for all the toastmaster clubs, developed by a toastmaster in New Zealand. :-)

The preset timer types are as follows:
- Role/Speech introduction (2 min)
- Welcome speech (3 min)
- Standard speech (7 min)
- Evaluation (3 min)
- Table topics evaluation (6 min)
- Table topics (2 min)
- Role reports (3 min)
- General evaluator report (5 min)

For the standard speech, table topics evaluation, and general evaluator report, the green light will be on 2 minutes before the time limit, and the yellow light will be on 1 minute before the time limit. For other preset timer types, the green light will be on 1 minute before the time limit, and the yellow light will be on 30 seconds before the time limit.

If you select the "Custom" timer type, you can specify the time limit, and the time when the green and yellow light will be on.

For timer types, the red light will be on once the time is up.

In terms of the timer counting directions, the timer starts to count down from the specified time limit. Once it reaches 00:00, it starts to count up. This design allow you to easily see how much extra time a speaker used.
